            I wrote my first lines of HTML and CSS in 2001, and ventured into the professional web development world in 2014.
            Since then, I’ve worked primarily as a contractor and freelancer, on projects ranging from local business landing pages 
            to gamified language learning applications.
            Lately I've been building a lot of fun things over at <a href="">Mapster</a>,
            mostly in <span>React</span>, <span>Wordpress</span> and <span>Mapbox.js</span>. 
            
            When I'm not at work, you can often find me tinkering with a musical instrument, or adventuring in the outdoors.
